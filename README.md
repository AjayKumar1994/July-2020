# kc_house_price_prediction
## In this project, I estimate the price of kc houses with the help of ML models.

I applied Regression and Machine Learning Algorithms to the data:

1. Linear Regression,

2. Ridge Regression,

3. Lasso Regression,

4. Bayesian Ridge

5. ElasticNet

6. KNN

7. SGD

8. Huber

9. RANSAC

10. GradientBoosting

11. AdaBoost

13. ExtraTree

14. Bagging

15. Random Forest and DecisionTree

16. XGB

Guess which one gives the best accuracy! It depends, we will see :)

Until then, ENJOY MACHINE LEARNING!
